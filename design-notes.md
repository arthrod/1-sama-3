# Design Notes: Cicero Email Service

## Selling Angle
I chose **Angle 1 — "Send it messy, get it back perfect."** combined with **Angle 5 — "The clarifying questions are the proof."**

The split-screen layout visually dramatizes the core value proposition: the transformation of chaos into order. By placing a realistic, messy "lawyer email" on the left and a pristine, structured Cicero response on the right, the user understands the service instantly without reading deep copy. The "Clarification Bridge" in the center is crucial—it turns the "black box" of AI into a trusted, interactive partner that asks the right questions (NY vs DE law), differentiating Cicero from generic LLMs.

## The Email Address as Hero
`assistant@cicero.im` is treated not just as a contact method, but as the *interface* itself.
- It appears in the hero section as a high-contrast code block.
- It anchors the bottom CTA with a massive font size (4rem+), making it the inevitable destination of the user's scroll.
- The use of `JetBrains Mono` for the address separates it from the `DM Sans` body, signaling "this is a tool/command."

## Standalone Viability
This design works effectively as a **standalone page**. It contains a complete narrative arc:
1.  **Hook**: "Send it messy."
2.  **Demo**: The visual before/after comparison.
3.  **Proof**: The clarification step showing intelligence.
4.  **Action**: The giant email address CTA.

It doesn't rely on the rest of the site's context to explain what Cicero is; the "Before/After" visual tells the whole story.
