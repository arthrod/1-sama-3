# Cicero Email Service Design Notes

## Brand Rules (Extracted)
- **Palette:** Scarlet (`#9d0208`) as the primary accent, Ink (`#1a1818`) for text, Warm White (`#f5f4f0`) for backgrounds, and Gray (`#e5e4e0`) for borders. Blue is strictly avoided.
- **Typography:** `Cormorant Garamond` for headings (evoking legal tradition), `DM Sans` for body (clean readability), and `JetBrains Mono` for the email address and technical elements.
- **Geometry:** Sharp corners (max 2px radius) to convey precision and professionalism.

## Design Thinking

### Selling Angle: "The Email Is The Interface"
I chose **Option G (Standalone Page)** because the email service is a distinct product with a unique value proposition that deserves focused attention. The primary selling angle is **"Send it messy, get it back perfect."** This addresses the core pain point of lawyers: they are overwhelmed and don't have time to format requests. By showing a chaotic input yielding a structured output, we prove the service's intelligence and utility instantly.

### The "Sacred" Email Address
The email address `assistant@cicero.im` is treated as the primary call-to-action. It is:
- Placed in the hero and the footer.
- Styled in `JetBrains Mono` to stand out from the serif/sans-serif text.
- Large and clickable (`mailto:`).
- Presented not just as contact info, but as the *product interface itself*.

### The Trust Signal
I prioritized the **Clarification Step** in the visual flow. By showing Cicero asking a specific question ("Should I align the liability cap?"), we demonstrate that this isn't a "dumb" AI wrapper but a thoughtful agent that understands legal nuance. This builds the trust necessary for a lawyer to hand over important work.

### Visual Motif
The "Two Attachments" concept (DOCX + PDF) is reinforced visually in the "After" state and the Use Case gallery. This consistency trains the user to expect a specific, high-value deliverable package every time.
