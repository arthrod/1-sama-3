# Cicero Design Notes

## Selling Angle: "Send it messy, get it back perfect"
The design prioritizes the "Before/After" split (Option A) combined with the "Clarification Step" (Option G elements). This angle hits hardest because it directly addresses the lawyer's primary pain point: the friction of preparing work for delegation. By showing a messy, informal email ("hey can you look at...") transforming into a polished, structured deliverable, we prove that Cicero handles the cognitive load, not just the typing. The visual contrast between the chaotic input and the structured output (DOCX + PDF pair) does the heavy lifting.

## The Inevitable CTA: `assistant@cicero.im`
The email address `assistant@cicero.im` is treated as the product interface itself, not just a contact method.
- **Visual Prominence**: It uses `JetBrains Mono` to stand out from the serif/sans-serif text, signaling "this is a tool/command".
- **Repetition**: It appears in the Hero (as a large, pill-shaped button), in the "Before" email header (as the recipient), and in the final "Manifesto" CTA.
- **Action-Oriented**: The surrounding copy ("Send it messy", "You need to forward an email") frames the address as a destination for immediate action, reinforcing that the workflow *is* the email.

## Standalone Viability
This design (Option G) is built to function as a complete, standalone landing page. It contains a self-sufficient narrative arc:
1.  **Hook**: The promise of perfection from chaos.
2.  **Proof**: The visual evidence of the transformation and the clarification step.
3.  **Value**: The feature grid explaining the "why" (two attachments, security).
4.  **Close**: The "Convenience Manifesto" that dismisses other tools.
It does not rely on the broader context of the main Cicero site and could serve as a dedicated destination for ad campaigns targeting "legal AI assistant" keywords.
