## Design Choices & Explanation
The design for Cicero was created by reinterpreting the "Sá Marias" codebase's structure and palette for a legal tech context.
- **Palette Adaptation**: The winery's `Merlot` color was directly mapped to the requested `Scarlet` for Cicero, maintaining the brand's premium feel but shifting the context from "luxury wine" to "high-stakes legal work". `Paper` and `Ink` tokens were preserved to maintain excellent readability and contrast.
- **Typography & Geometry**: The shift from *Playfair Display/Lato* (winery) to *Cormorant Garamond/DM Sans* (legal) immediately changes the tone from "romantic/rustic" to "authoritative/precise". Sharpening the border radius from rounded to 0px reinforces this precision.
- **Structural Re-use**: The "Featured Wines" grid pattern was repurposed as the "Active Matters" dashboard, demonstrating how the underlying layout engine could be reused for a completely different vertical.
