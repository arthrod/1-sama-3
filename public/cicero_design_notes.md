# Design Notes: Cicero Email Service Page

### Selling Angle
The **"Before/After"** visualization (Messy Email vs. Perfect Deliverables) landed hardest. It immediately communicates the value proposition: you don't need to change your behavior (sending messy emails) to get a professional result. The contrast between the chaotic input and the structured output (DOCX + PDF) does the heavy lifting.

### The CTA
`assistant@cicero.im` is treated not just as contact info, but as the interface itself. By styling it in **JetBrains Mono** and giving it a dedicated, high-contrast button in the Hero and Footer, it feels like a tool you activate, not just an address you write to. The "Copy" or "Email" action becomes the primary interaction of the page.

### Page Context
This design functions best as a **standalone product page** (Option G). It assumes the user is already interested in the email workflow specifically. As a section of a larger landing page, it would need to be condensed, but as a standalone destination, it effectively guides the user through the entire mental model: Problem -> Workflow -> Proof -> Trust -> Action.
