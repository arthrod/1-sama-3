Cicero Design Exploration - Notes

1. The "Invisible" UI
   - The core value of Cicero is that it lives in your existing workflow (email).
   - I chose to make the landing page explicitly demonstrate this by showing the "Input" as a standard email client interface.
   - This "Before/After" comparison is the hero of the page because it instantly explains the product without abstract diagrams.

2. Visual Differentiation (No Blue)
   - Legal tech often defaults to "Trust Blue" (Salesforce, DocuSign).
   - Cicero uses Scarlet (#9d0208) and severe Black/White contrast to signal something different: urgency, precision, and a "red pen" editorial authority.
   - The typography (Cormorant Garamond) evokes the authority of printed legal briefs, while the monospace (JetBrains Mono) ties it to the technical/email nature of the input.

3. Sharp Geometry
   - I avoided all border-radius (except for a minimal 2px on the CTA box) to reinforce the idea of "strictness" and "precision" required in legal documents.
   - Soft curves suggest "friendly/casual"; sharp corners suggest "binding/exact".

4. Hierarchy
   - The email address `assistant@cicero.im` is treated as the primary product interface. It is given the most visual weight after the headline.
   - The pricing is simplified to a retainer model, reflecting how firms actually pay for outside counsel.
