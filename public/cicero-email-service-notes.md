# Cicero Email Service Design Notes

## Selling Angle
I focused on **Angle 3: "No copy-paste. No context-switching. Just email."** and **Angle 6: "Two attachments. Everything you need."** The design emphasizes the friction-free nature of the service—you send a messy email and get back a structured package. The visual of the email thread (showing the clarification loop) and the deliverable pair (DOCX + PDF) reinforces that the product is a workflow, not just a tool.

## The Email Address as CTA
`assistant@cicero.im` is treated as the primary interface element. It appears in the hero as a large, clickable `mailto:` link with a copy-to-clipboard hint, and again in the footer as the final call to action. The use of a monospace font distinguishes it from the rest of the text, making it feel technical and precise—like a command line for legal work.

## Standalone Viability
This design works as a standalone page because it tells a complete story: problem (messy email), solution (Cicero workflow), proof (clarification + deliverables), and social proof (use cases). It doesn't rely on the rest of the site for context, making it ideal for targeted ad campaigns or direct email marketing.
