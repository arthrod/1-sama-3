# Design Notes: Cicero Email Service Page

## Chosen Selling Angle
The **"Send it messy, get it back perfect" (Angle 1)** landed the hardest. Visualizing the chaos of a real lawyer's email against the pristine order of the returned DOCX + PDF package makes the value proposition instant and visceral. It doesn't require reading copy to understand; the visual contrast tells the story. I positioned this "Before/After" comparison immediately after the hero to hook the user before explaining the mechanics.

## The Inevitable CTA: `assistant@cicero.im`
To make the email address feel like the product itself, I treated it as the primary interface element:
1.  **Typography**: I used `JetBrains Mono` to distinguish it from the marketing copy, signaling "this is a tool/code/action" not just text.
2.  **Visual Weight**: In the hero, it is styled as a large, high-contrast button with an icon, making it impossible to miss. It is not buried in a paragraph.
3.  **Repetition**: It appears prominently in the Hero (the start of the journey) and the final CTA section (the destination), creating a loop.
4.  **Context**: The "Workflow" section explicitly shows the address in the "To:" and "From:" fields of the timeline, reinforcing that the *address is the UI*.

## Standalone Capability
This design works effectively as a **standalone page (Option G)**. It has a complete narrative arc:
1.  **Hook**: The promise of perfection from chaos.
2.  **Proof**: The visual evidence of the transformation.
3.  **Trust**: The "Clarification Loop" showing intelligence.
4.  **Mechanics**: The timeline showing how easy it is.
5.  **Features**: Addressing specific pain points (context switching, security).
6.  **Close**: The final invitation to use the service.

While the "Before/After" and "Workflow" sections could easily be dropped into the main landing page, the dedicated page allows for a focused, distraction-free pitch that treats the email service as a serious, full-featured product rather than just a feature bullet.
