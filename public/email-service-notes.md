# Design Notes: Cicero Email Service Marketing Page

## Concept: The Standalone Page (Option G + A)
I chose to design a **Standalone Email Service Page** (Option G) but heavily incorporated the **Before/After Split** (Option A) as the central visual argument. The standalone format allows us to fully explain the unique workflow ("Send it messy"), while the split comparison immediately validates the core value proposition: "Input chaos, output clarity."

## Selling Angles
The strongest selling angle in this design is **"Send it messy, get it back perfect."** The visual contrast between the chaotic, informal lawyer email (Arial font, casual tone) and the structured, professional response (Cicero branding, clear structure, dual attachments) does the heavy lifting. It proves the service isn't just a template filler but an intelligent partner that handles the "drudgery gap."

## The "Inevitable" CTA
To make `assistant@cicero.im` feel inevitable, I treated it as both the product *and* the call-to-action. By placing it in a distinctive monospace font inside a button-like container in the hero and footer, it bridges the mental gap between "learning about the service" and "using the service." It's not just contact info; it's the interface.

## Deviation Note
Due to environment restrictions preventing `npm install` (and thus `puppeteer`), I utilized the pre-installed Python/Playwright environment to generate the screenshots via `scripts/screenshot_email_service.py`. This ensures the visual verification is accurate without breaking build constraints.
