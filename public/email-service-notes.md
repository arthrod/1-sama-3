# Cicero Email Service Design Notes

**Selling Angle:**
The "Send it messy, get it back perfect" angle landed hardest in this design. The visual contrast between the informal, chaotic email input and the structured, professional legal output (DOCX + PDF) immediately communicates the value proposition without needing complex explanations.

**The Email Address:**
To make `assistant@cicero.im` feel like the inevitable next action, I treated it as a piece of UI rather than just text. Setting it in a large monospace font (`JetBrains Mono`) with a sharp scarlet underline gives it the weight of a technical tool or command, distinguishing it from the rest of the body copy.

**Page Strategy:**
This design functions effectively as a standalone landing page (Scenario G) because it builds a complete narrative arc: it starts with a high-level promise, proves the mechanism with the step-by-step workflow, validates it with specific use cases, and concludes with a direct call to action. It doesn't rely on the context of a larger site to make sense.
