Design Explanation:

1. Selling Angle:
   I focused heavily on **"Send it messy, get it back perfect"** and **"Just email"**. The split-screen comparison immediately validates the user's pain (messy inputs, lack of time) and offers the solution (perfect deliverables) without friction. The "No portals, no logins" copy reinforces the convenience angle.

2. Email Prominence:
   `assistant@cicero.im` is treated as the primary interface. I placed it in the Hero as a large, clickable `mailto:` link, and repeated it in the Footer as the final CTA. It also appears in every example card, reinforcing that the email address *is* the product. I used a monospace font for the address to give it a technical, tool-like feel, distinguishing it from the marketing copy.

3. Standalone Page Rationale:
   I chose **Option G (The Standalone Email Service Page)** because this service is a distinct product offering that deserves its own focused narrative. A standalone page allows for a complete story arc: Problem (Messy inputs) -> Solution (Cicero workflow) -> Proof (Deliverables & Use Cases) -> Action (Email now). This structure builds trust and understanding more effectively than a single section on a general landing page could.

4. Trust Signals:
   I explicitly included the "Clarify" step in the workflow to address the skepticism that an AI might "guess" wrong. Showing that Cicero asks questions builds confidence in its accuracy. The "DOCX + PDF" deliverable pair is used consistently to show concrete value.
