# Cicero Design Brief

## Codebase Analysis
- **Predominance of Winery Code:** The codebase is primarily focused on the "Sá Marias" winery project (`src/app/page.tsx`, `src/styles/samarias.css`, `public/llms.html`).
- **Absence of Cicero Files:** Despite the prompt's premise, no "Cicero" files (`cicero.html`, specific design tokens) were found in the file tree.
- **Inference:** I must treat the prompt's description as the "virtual codebase" for Cicero's design tokens and constraints.

## Design Constraints (Inferred)
- **Palette:**
    - Scarlet: `#9d0208` (Primary/Accent)
    - Ink: `#1a1818` (Background/Text)
    - Warm White: `#f5f4f0` (Paper/Surface)
    - Gray: `#e5e4e0` (Secondary/Border)
- **Typography:**
    - Display: **Cormorant Garamond** (Serif)
    - Body: **DM Sans** (Sans-serif)
    - Code/Email: **JetBrains Mono** (Monospace)
- **Geometry:** Sharp (max 2px radius). No soft shadows.
- **Product:** "Cicero" - Email-based legal document assistant. No dashboard. Converts messy email -> structured DOCX/PDF.
- **Motif:** Before/After (messy email -> clean doc).

## Design Rationale
- **Gap:** Since no visual representation exists, I am designing the **Landing Page** from scratch.
- **Focus:** Highlight the "No Dashboard" value proposition and the "Messy Email -> Clean Doc" transformation.
- **Pricing:** Introducing a tiered pricing model (Free/Pro/Firm) to give the product a "real" feel.
